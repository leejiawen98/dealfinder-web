DealFinder is a Business to Consumer (B2C) mobile application platform that allows consumers to purchase deals from various selected businesses. It also serves as a platform to curate deals into one place so that consumers can discover them.
There could be exclusive deals offered by the businesses that are only available on the mobile application which could entice consumers to use the application.

This project also features a JSF Web Application that allows Business Accounts to upload and post their deals that would be reflected in the mobile application.
